# wasabi
A command line tool to quickly create JS abstractions for your Ethereum Smart contracts. Wasabi creates JS objects that allow you to easily deploy and interact with Ethereum Smart contracts.

# Getting started
Wasabi is cooking. Check back shortly. I don't promise for anything to work as expected (yet).

## Initialize
Create a new project in a directory
```
wasabi init
```

## Build
Create a new project in a directory
```
wasabi build
```

## Deploy
Create a new project in a directory
```
wasabi deploy
```

## Demo
Create a new project in a directory
```
wasabi serve
```

Note: Wasabi is being used for my personal projects to understand JSON RPC interactions essentional for a fully function Dapp. All the features are built to serve my own desperate needs. If you'd love to do something, feel free to go crazy with nice and descriptive pull requests.
